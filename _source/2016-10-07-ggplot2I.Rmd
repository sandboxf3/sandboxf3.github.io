## Introduction
<br/>
This series discusses how we can use ggplot2 to produce plots for each column 
of a data frame that depend on characteristics of this column 
(e.g. the class of a column) in a scalable manner.
To this end, we integrate the following concepts / functions:

* the `ggplot2` package
* `lapply`
* anonymous functions
* non-standard evaluation
* lexical scoping

The reader should be familiar with these concepts, otherwise, Hadley Wickham's
[Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz) might be a good starting point to read 
up on all but the first topic.

The approach discussed here generalizes to other situations in which one wants
to customize plots based on the characteristics of input data. 

## The problem
<br/>
For this blog post, we are going to use a subset of the diamonds data set.
```{r, message=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
source("multiplot.R") # http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Multiple_graphs_on_one_page_(ggplot2)/
```

```{r}
dta <- select(diamonds, price, cut, carat, color)
head(dta)
```

Now, imagine you want a visual summary for each variable. Unfortunately, 
the variables are not all of the same class. Otherwise, you might transform the 
data into long format and use facets.
For the factors, you could do a bar chart, for the numerical variables, you might want to
use a density plot. Let's have a look at a first approach. You could do the 
following for cut and color. 
```{r}
p1 <- ggplot(dta, aes(cut))   + geom_bar()
p2 <- ggplot(dta, aes(color)) + geom_bar()
```

Similarly, you can do for price and carat
```{r}
p3 <- ggplot(dta, aes(price)) + geom_density()
p4 <- ggplot(dta, aes(carat)) + geom_density()
```
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# create a plot with 4 panels
multiplot(p1, p2, p3, p4, cols = 2)
```

<br/>

Now, you can note two issues:

* There is a lot of code duplication. For each plot, you need another line of
  code that is almost identical to the ones you have already. This is not
  scalable to data sets with many columns. This problem will be addressed in this
  post.
* You might want to further customize your plots. For
  example, changing the x-axis of the density plots from linear to logarithmic 
  might be desirable to make better use of space. This problem will be addressed
  in the second part of the series.


  
  
## A solution
<br/>
To address the first problem, we can create a function that
behaves differently depending on whether the input is factorial or numeric.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# a function that returns geom_density if the input is numeric, 
# geom_bar otherwise
geom_hist_or_bar <- function() {
  if(current_class() %in% c("integer", "numeric")) {
  geom_density()
  } else {
  geom_bar()
  }
}
```
`current_class` is a function that magically gets the class of the variable
that you used in `aes` of `ggplot`. It will be explained at a later stage.
Having defined that function, you could rewrite the above as follows:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(dta, aes(color)) + geom_hist_or_bar()
ggplot(dta, aes(cut))   + geom_hist_or_bar()
ggplot(dta, aes(price)) + geom_hist_or_bar()
ggplot(dta, aes(carat)) + geom_hist_or_bar()
```
This is a slight improvement on the first solution because you always call the
same functions for all plots. Hence, we can kind of use an `apply` approach to 
reduce the redundancy of this problem. You might think of the following:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
lapply(dta, function(g) ggplot(dta, aes(g)) + geom_hist_or_bar)
```
Unfortunately, this does not quite work because for each iteration in 
`lapply`, `g` will be the actual 
values from each column, but in `aes`, you need the name of the column, not the 
actual value. Since there is no way to get from the values to the names, but 
if we have the names, we can get the values, the trick is to loop over the names
of the data frame.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
lapply(names(dta), function(g) ggplot(dta, aes(g)) + geom_hist_or_bar)
```
However, we are not quite there yet. Due to non-standard evaluation, we need to 
further change two things:

* use `aes_` instead of `aes` so `g` is not actually g, but points to something
  else.
* use `as.name(g)` instead of `g` because `g` is just the name of an object (i.e. 
  "cut" for the first iteration), not the object itself. 
  
```{r, eval=FALSE}
lapply(names(dta), function(g) {
  ggplot(dta, aes_(as.name(g))) + 
    geom_hist_or_bar() +
    scale_x_adapt()
})

```
The only explanation I still owe you is how the function `current_class()` works.
It only works because it is called from within `lapply`. 
Hence, the parent frame of `current_class` (the function that *calls* 
`current_class`) has `lapply` as its parent. For a given iteration, 
the value of g is available in the environment of `lapply`. `currrent_class` 
simply needs to go *up the tree* until it reaches the environment of `lapply` 
and get the value of g and figure out it's class. That is done as follows.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
current_class <- function() {
  # returns the first class of the current iteration*
  class(dta[[get("g", parent.frame(n = 2))]])[1]
}
# * first element since object can have multiple classes
```

Now, we are done. This is all code we need to get our solution.
```{r}
##  ............................................................................
##  get set up
library("tidyverse")
source("multiplot.R") # http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Multiple_graphs_on_one_page_(ggplot2)/

##  ............................................................................
##  define helper functions
current_class <- function() {
  # returns the first class of the current iteration*
  class(dta[[get("g", parent.frame(n = 2))]])[1]
}
# * first element since object can have multiple classes

geom_hist_or_bar <- function() {
  color <- "gray"
  if (current_class() %in% c("integer", "numeric")) {
  geom_density(color = color, fill = color)
  } else if(current_class() %in% c("factor", "ordered")){
  geom_bar(color = color, fill = color)
  }
}

##  ............................................................................
##  create all plots
all_plots <- lapply(names(dta), function(g) {
  ggplot(dta, aes_(as.name(g))) + 
    geom_hist_or_bar()
  }
)

```

Finally, we can plot the result.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# use plotlist not ... as input
do.call("multiplot", list(plotlist = all_plots, cols = 2)) 
```

## Conclusion
<br/>
In this blog post, a few advanced concepts from the R toolbox were integrated 
in order to create column-wise visual data summaries. To this end, we 
created a set of functions which can be used to generate plots for different 
data types (numerical and factorial). 
This set of functions can be used in conjunction with `lapply` to
create summary plots, which would not be possible if different functions had to
be called for the different data types. The solution presented above is
scalable to data sets with an arbitrary number of columns without altering the 
code.

## Outlook
<br/>
We will expand on this by customizing the appearance of the plots further.
Namely, the second part of the series centers on using a log-transformed
x-scale for continuous data and how to generate appropriate breaks, but the
principles we will develop there can be generalized well to other customization
needs.
