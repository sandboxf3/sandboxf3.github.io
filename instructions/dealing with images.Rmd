Until the very end, do as normal. Then: 

* Save images as png with a name that starts with the date of the publication 
  the image belongs to.
* Set the command that produces the immage in its own code chunck, and set 
  `eval = FALSE`. 
* Build the site locally and test the outcome. It should NOT show any pictures.
* Include a stable link to your devel repository.
* Deploy the site to github  *devel* branch.
* Check whether the local build looks good.
* Merge devel with master and push master to github.
