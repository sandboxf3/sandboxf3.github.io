Recently, I have been involved in the following projects related to 
software development: 

- *refactor. Better factor handling with R.* This is an 
  R package that aims to make working with categorical variables
  more fun. Have a look at the 
  [GitHub Page](https://jonmcalder.github.io/refactor/) of the project or at the
  [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jonmcalder/refactor).

- *strcode. Structure and abstract your code.* A package that mainly provides 
  RStudio Add-ins to insert code breaks as well as tools to analyse code. Check
  out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lorenzwalthert/strcode) here.
  
- *Bono Usu: A guide for good practive in R programming.* This is a book written
  with the R package [bookdown](https://bookdown.org) and covers some topics in 
  the broader sense of good programming practice. You can view the
  [built book](https://lorenzwalthert.github.io/bonousu/) or the 
  [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lorenzwalthert/bonousu), the latter contains
  the code to build the book.
