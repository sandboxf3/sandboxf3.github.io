I am pleased to announce my package strcode (short for structuring code), a package that should make structuring code easer. You can install it from github, a CRAN submission is planned at a later stage.

{% highlight r %}
devtools::install_github("lorenzwalthert/strcode")
{% endhighlight %}


## Inserting code breaks with ease
The main feature of the package is its function to insert code breaks. These are helpful in breaking the code down to smaller sections. We suggest three levels of granularity for code structuring, whereas higher-level blocks can contain lower-level blocks:

- level 1 sections, which are high-level blocks that can be separated as follows:

{% highlight r %}
#   ________________________________________________________
#   A title                                             ####
{% endhighlight %}

- level 2 sections, which are medium-level blocks that can be separated as follows:

{% highlight r %}
##  ........................................................
##  A subtitle                                          ####
{% endhighlight %}


- level 3 sections, which are low-level blocks that can be separated as follows:

{% highlight r %}
### . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..
### Another one                                         ####
{% endhighlight %}


You can notice from the above that

* The number of `#` used in front of the break character (`___`, `...`, `. .`) corresponds to the level of granularity that is separated.
* The breaks characters `___`, `...`, `. .` were chosen such that they reflect the level of granularity, namely `___` has a much higher visual density than `. .`. 
* Each block has an (optional) short title on what that block is about.
* Every title ends with `####`. Therefore, the titles are recognized by RStudio as [sections](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200484568-Code-Folding-and-Sections). This has the advantages that you can get a quick summary of your code in Rstudio's code pane and you can fold sections as you can fold code or function declarations or if statements. See the pictures below for details.


The separators all have length 80. The value is looked up in the global option `strcode$char_length` and can therefore be changed by the user.

# Anchoring sections
Sometimes it is required to refer to a code section, which can be done by title. A better way, however, is to use a unique hash sequence - let us call it a code anchor - to create an arguably unique reference to that section. A code anchor in `strcode` is enclosed by `#<` and `>#` so all anchors can be found using regular expressions. You can add section breaks that include a hash. That might look like this

{% highlight r %}
##  ........ #< bdd0351ff9987e58fec1e1d3dbcdd8d1 ># ........
##  An anchored section                                 ####
{% endhighlight %}


# Summarizing code
Once code has been structured by adding sections (as above), it can easily be summarized or represented in a compact and abstract form. This is particularly handy when the codebase is large, when a lot of people work on the code or when new people join a project. The function `sum_str` is designed for the purpose of extracting separators and respective comments, in order to provide high level code summaries. It is highly customizable and flexible, with a host of options. Thanks to RStudio's API, you can even create summaries of the file you are working on, simply by typing `sum_str()` in the console.
That might look like this

{% highlight r %}
Summarized structure of ~/datasciencecoursera/strcode/vignettes/strcode.Rmd

line  level section
46	#   ____________________________________
47	#   A title
54	##  A subtitle
95	## .....................................
96	##  An anchored section
162	#   ____________________________________
163	#   function test
166	##  A: pre-processing
217	##  B: actual function
243	#   ____________________________________
244	#   function test2
247	##  A: pre-processing
298	##  B: actual function
{% endhighlight %}



## Insert a code anchor
Code anchors might prove helpful in other situations where one want to anchor a single line. That is also possible with `strcode`. An example of a code anchor is the following:


{% highlight r %}
#< 56f5139874167f4f5635b42c37fd6594 >#
this_is_a_super_important_but_hard_to_describe_line_so_let_me_anchor_it
{% endhighlight %}
The hash sequences in strcode are produced with the R package 
[digest](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/digest).
